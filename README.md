# Table Question Answering (TQA) with LLMs: Large Language Model-Based Natural Language Question Answering over Structured Tabular Data

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of *Table Question Answering (TQA)* using *Large Language Models (LLMs)*. The goal is to enable users to interact with structured data (like CSV files) through natural language questions and get precise, context-aware answers. By leveraging the capabilities of advanced language models, we bridge the gap between raw tabular data and human-like querying.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Load and parse structured tabular data (CSV files)
- ✅ Use natural language questions to query the data
- ✅ Retrieve direct and context-aware answers using LLMs
- ✅ Handle complex table queries including aggregations, filters, and multi-column conditions
- ✅ Interactive user interface / CLI (based on your implementation)
- ✅ Scalable design for plugging in different datasets

## 🧠 How It Works

1. *Data Loading*: The user provides a CSV file which is parsed and structured into a readable format.
2. *User Query*: A natural language question is input by the user (e.g., "What is the average salary of employees in the IT department?")
3. *Prompt Engineering*: The table data and the question are converted into a format suitable for the LLM using a prompt template.
4. *LLM Querying*: The question and structured context are passed to the LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT, or any custom-hosted model).
5. *Answer Extraction*: The model processes the input and returns a precise, human-readable answer.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas for data handling
- OpenAI / Hugging Face Transformers for LLMs
- Streamlit / Gradio / CLI (depending on your UI)
- Prompt engineering techniques
- PyMySQL or SQLite (if SQL-style querying is included)

## 📊 Example Use Case

*Table:* Employees.csv  
*Question:* "Who has the highest salary in the Marketing department?"  
*Answer (from LLM):* "John Smith has the highest salary in the Marketing department, earning $98,000."

## ✨ Key Highlights

- Natural and intuitive interaction with structured data
- Model-agnostic implementation (can work with various LLMs)
- Excellent for BI, analytics, and data exploration tasks
- Potential for integration into enterprise data dashboards

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Fine-tuned models for domain-specific table QA  
- Incorporate multilingual support  
- Add voice query capability  
- Integrate with SQL databases and live data sources  
- Improve error handling and ambiguity resolution
